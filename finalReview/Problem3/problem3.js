/*
Problem 3:

The html contains a left div, and a right div.
When the user clicks the ball, it should go to the other div

Suggestion: Maybe use jQuery.delegate?

If you're stumped, try getting something to log to the console
if the ball is clicked, THEN worry about moving the ball div.

$(document).ready(function () {
	function onClick(left);
	console.log(left.move right);
	consol.log(left.currentTarget);
}
function onclick(right) {
	console.log(right.move let);
	console.log(right.currentTarget);
	
}
});
